## Bond Portfolio Management

Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in applying key fixed income concepts such as annuity pricing, yield curve dynamics, and forward rate interpretation. We also developed a deeper understanding of how to measure and manage interest rate risk and the effects of time passage (theta) on bond prices. Using these tools, we constructed a zero-coupon bond portfolio that performed well over the 35-day holding period, with a positive HPR that reinforced the practical value of our analytical approach. This exercise helped bridge theoretical learning with real-world fixed income portfolio construction.
